# Hello, I'm Nacho Rapallo

### I should say that I am a programmer, but I feel more identified with the word ***artisan***.

### As a [software craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) I choose programming tools, languages and libraries that adapt to what I need to design or implement. In continuous learning, looking for the best tools that adapt to what I want to build.

### I feel identified with the original definition of the word hacker: person who enjoys the exploration of the details of the programmable systems and how to take advantage of their possibilities, unlike those who prefer to learn only the essential.

### I have tested all Javascript flavours: [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com), [ActionScript](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript), [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) now.

### I have worked with [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/es/intro-whatis.php), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), [Node](https://nodejs.org/es/) and now [React](https://es.reactjs.org)/[Redux](https://es.redux.js.org)/[Next](https://nextjs.org) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

### I also make mobile applications with <a href="https://reactnative.dev" target="_blank">React Native</a> and <a href="https://expo.dev" target="_blank">expo</a>, also desktop applications with [NW.js](https://nwjs.io) o [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).

### I love the UI/UX.

### I try to do simple beautiful things that work.
